This repository contains the files necessary to reproduce the Unity Project created for my Honours reseatch project.
The Project requires PTC's Vuforia Engine to be installed. So you will either need to download this through the Unity Editor from the Asset Store, or add the "com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.8.4.tgz" to your Packages/ directory. The rest of the required project files should be generated for you upon creating a new Unity Project from this folder, using Unity Hub.

The Vuforia .tgz file can be found at the following link:
