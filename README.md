This repository contains the files necessary to reproduce the Unity Project created for my Honours reseatch project.
The Project requires PTC's Vuforia Engine to be installed. So you will either need to download this through the Unity Editor from the Asset Store, or add the "com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.8.4.tgz" to your Packages/ directory. The rest of the required project files should be generated for you upon creating a new Unity Project from this folder, using Unity Hub.

The Vuforia .tgz file can be found at the following link:
https://uctcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/brnjam019_myuct_ac_za/EhCoSJTYkXNCqy_dV9n7cHwBiPGQQ7suXeZAe3veXiFmIQ?e=9iBA50

The entire .zip Unity Project (1.7GB compressed) and Boxes directory can also both be found at the above link.

To replicate my Unity Project successfully, add the "com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.8.4.tgz" file to the Packages/ driectory, then in Unity Hub:
Select the 'Open' dropdown -> Add files from disk -> select the downloaded repo folder. This should create and run a new Unity Project.
